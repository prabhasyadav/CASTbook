**Sandhya** and **Iram**, to do this.

**Sandhya** and **Iram** - 2D models


OK, this is how we do:

1. Describe each model - this we already have
2. Provide how to use the code with screenshots
3. Step 2 should talk a bit about input value and about functionalities - e.g., slider and how to interpret results
4. We have to do this for both single and multiple scenario mode.

We do this for all models.
