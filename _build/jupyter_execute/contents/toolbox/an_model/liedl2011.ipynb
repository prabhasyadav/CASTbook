    "This model, based on {ref}`Liedl et al. (2011)<refli2011>`, provides an estimate of a steady-state plume length ($L_{max}$ ) from a 3D model domain (see figure). This model extends the 2D model present in Liedl et al. (2005). As is in the 2D model, in this model too the vertical orientation refers to $z$-axis being aligned to the aquifer thickness. The domain width and length is infinite in this model.\n",
