## Quick example of offline CAST

CAST is a browser based tool. This basically means the code are run in the browser either on the Online or on the offline mode. There is no difference between the usage or application between online and offline mode.

Since Offline mode of CAST locally installed, the user can modify the codes as per their requirements. More importantly in the offline version user can set their own parameter range, which is restrictive in the online mode due to requirements of online computing. Installation of offline mode of CAST is extensively presented [here](../../contents/offline/offline_installation.md)

In the offline mode browser will have series of the numbers such as 127.0.0.1:500 or something called `localhost` followed by some numbers. These are site address based on user's computer. See the screenshot below.
